        City in New York that starts with my last name: Palatine
        <br>University in Palatine: Purchase College
        <br>Mascot of Purchase College: <h3><p style="color:seagreen;"><em>Panther</em></p></h3>
        <p>
            <h3>Fun Facts about the Mascot</h3>
            <br>Been around PC since the late 1960s, but my role really <br>took off during the 1980s when we changed our school <br>colors to Orange and Blue to look more like the NY Knicks, <br>who were sharing the facility with us. The Panther name, <br>backed by the Orange and Blue, provided a rebirth of sorts for athletics. <br>Around 2006, the campus gave me my name, Perseus, honoring the Greek mythology figure of the same name.
